Starscream is no longer under active development. I moved it to GitHub when 
Google Code announced that they were shutting down. I keep this code around 
for posterity as a reminder of how much I learned about software development 
after I first wrote this code in 2008.

This code is built with CMake. After installing CMake, FFTW and GSL, you can 
build Starscream with the following instructions.

1.) Create a directory called starscream_build, somewhere outside the 
starscream directory, and move into it. I prefer ../starscream_build.
2.) From your starscream_build directory, run

cmake ../starscream -DFFTW_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/fftw-3.2.2_gcc-4.5.1/include/ \
-DFFTW_LIBS_PATH=/opt/fftw-3.2.2_gcc-4.5.1/lib/ \
-DGSL_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/gsl-1.9_gcc-4.3/include/ \
-DGSL_LIBS_PATH=/opt/gsl-1.9_gcc-4.3/lib/ \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Be sure to update the paths for FFTW and GSL as needed.

3.) Run the make and make install commands in the build directory.

make
make install

You can change the default installation directory by passing the argument 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<the new directory>.

If it compiles without error, from your build directory run ./src/starscream_test.
