----- WARNING! -----
The GSL appears to be missing from your system! 

This message should only appear if you tried to link to your own install of 
the GSL using the "--with-gsl=" function. In that case, please note that this
option only works with the statically compiled versions of the GSL and that you
may be missing those files.

If you received this message without setting "--with-gsl=" option, something
has gone horribly wrong and you should use the back-up makefile. 

----- END WARNING ----
