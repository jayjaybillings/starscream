This code has an Autoconf-enabled build system. You should be able to compile
and install it with:

./configure
make
make check
make install

If you have special build requirements, check 

./configure --help

If, for some reason, you do not have autoconf or cannot build with autoconf,
Makefile.back should work for you with some minor edits.

Please don't hesitate to email the author if you have questions or comments.
