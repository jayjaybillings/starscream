Starscream is a code that I have developed for creating galaxy progenitors for N-body codes. The code implements a Springel-Hernquist model with a dark matter halo and a stellar disk, in a nutshell, and can write these initial conditions to a GADGET2 input file or others. More information is available in the manual.

**Version 1.x**
The code is free to anyone who would like to use it, but comes with no warranty, neither expressed nor implied.

There are some videos of galaxy collisions created with Starscream and GADGET2 on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/jayjaybillings).

Release Status: v1.1â€“ 20110625, available [here](http://code.google.com/p/starscream/downloads/list). Made a fix to support FFTW-3.2.2.

Repo Update: Replaced Autoconf with CMake!

License Info: Starscream 1.x is released under the GPL.

Support: I no longer actively support Starscream. If you email me with questions, please understand that I may not be able to answer all of them because I am financially supported by other work and have very little time to work on Starscream.

**Version 2.x**
I used to have a blurb up here saying that Starscream 2 was under development and would be released in Java, etc. Unfortunately, there will most likely never be a second release of this code because of my existing commitments to other projects.
